## Game of Life

Let it run and observe this small simulated 'world' evolves from its random starting point. Will it reach equilibirum ?

### World rules:
1. Any live cell with 0 or 1 live neighbour dies because of underpopulation
2. Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbours stays alive, because its neighbourhood is just right
3. Any live cell with more than 3 neighbours dies, because of overpopulation
4. Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbours becomes alive, because of reproduction

### To run it:

1. clone it: 
`git clone https://github.com/PierreMrt/game_of_life.git`

2. run it:
`python main.py`
